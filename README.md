**Overview of the Analysis**

The objective of this analysis is to provide a potential investor in a surf and ice-cream shop with temperature trends for the months of June and December for the years 2010 to 2017 on the island of Oahu. 

The analysis will provide the investor with statistics for the dataset of temperatures for the months of June and December, so that he can determine the sustainability of the surf and ice-cream shop business.

The data used for the analysis is stored in a SQLite database. SQLAlchemy is used for the code written using Python to communicate with the database.

To obtain the statistics about the temperature trends and to present it to the investor, the following have been used:
- Python queries to extract the data from the database as well as filters to get the data specific to the months on June and December.
- The Matplotlib library has been used to visualize the data.
